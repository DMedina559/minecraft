# What is This?
This is an addon for Minecraft Bedrock Edition version 1.20+

# What Does This Addon Do?
This addon that changes the default loot for suspicious blocks as well as allows player placed suspicious blocks to drop loot.

# Why?
The vanilla loot for the suspicious blocks never really made sense to me. So I decided to make this addon to make them drop loot that better fits Archeology. If you feel there should be something added, let me know in the comments and I'll look into it.
