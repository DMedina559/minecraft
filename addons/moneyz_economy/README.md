# Moneyz Economy
This is an addon for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Moneyz Economy is a function pack that allows you to buy items, apply for jobs and much more. A modified version is also used in the world MountainSide Villages 1.1.0+

This function pack is for use with the NPC mob as every command is executed as @initiatior.
To use without NPCs use a text editior and replace @initiatior with @p or @s inistead in every file. (Sublime Text editior makes this easy with CTR+Shift+F)

The raw folder contains every function file with all the commands that are executed. 
Feel free to download and edit these to your liking or use in your world.
