# Moneyz Economy
Moneyz Economy is a function pack for Minecraft Bedrock, that allows you to buy items, apply for jobs and much more. A modified version is also used in the world MountainSide Villages 1.1.0+

Moneyz Economy allows you to easily add a bustling economy to any of your worlds! Just simply spawn an npc and enter the function command (e.g. function petshop/pets/dog) and now you have a shops person to sell you items, houses, or even give you a job.

### Why use NPCs and not Chat Commands or Command Blocks?
I decided to use NPC's for this pack as all commands are ran as @initiator instead of @p or @s. This means all commands are ran as the person interacting with the NPC and not any close player that happens to meet the requirements. (You can easily change this in any text editor.)
