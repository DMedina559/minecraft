6. Revamped the Moneyz System (read below)
### Revamped Moneyz
Moneyz has been completely revamped. It no longer uses command blocks and now uses NPCs. All Moneyz commands have been completely moved to the included behavior pack ‘Moneyz Economy’. 

The move to NPCs and a Behavior Pack allows for easier maintenance, and fixes having to be in a certain radius of the command blocks. The move to a Behavior pack also allows it to easily be used in other worlds as well.

(You’ll need to activate the ‘Moneyz Economy’ behavior pack first. [This is so you can play with achievements if you decide not play with Moneyz])
